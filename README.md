# personalLibraryApp

A library app following I made practice the object constructors.

The clean and beautiful layout is thanks to [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)

## Requirements

- On page load add the book to the page.
- A form that allows user to add new books
- A delete button.
- A checkbox to handle the read status of the book

## Object Constructors

The focus of this project was to create this app using Object Constructors and
being able to reduce the code by doing so.

## LocalStorage

It was a fine opportunity to learn and apply
LocalStorage. I learned about the basics of it using the ChatGPT
and also learned about JSON _stringify_ and _parse_ methods which made handling the
data extremely easy.
